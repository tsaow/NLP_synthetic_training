{"prompt": "make some code that functions the same as the following code: There are several key differences between JavaScript and Python. \n\nJavaScript is primarily a client-side scripting language, while Python is predominantly a server-side scripting language. JavaScript is an interpreted language which means that it does not need to be compiled before running, whereas Python needs to be compiled before it can run. JavaScript is a loosely typed language and allows for variables to have different data types, whereas Python is a strongly typed language and variables have to be given a specific data type. JavaScript can be used to create dynamic webpages with interactive content, while Python is optimized to work with packages and modules, making it a better choice for complex tasks and data analysis. but is not the same. just give one example and only return the code."}
